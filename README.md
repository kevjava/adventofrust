# Advent of Rust

So, I'm learning Rust. This is me fumbling around with strange mechanics of a new programming language, so it is mostly bad code and not really meant to be something that you can learn from. Someday maybe I'll go through and refactor this stuff to figure out how I can do it in a more "rusty" way.

All that is to say that if you stumble onto this repository, don't judge just yet. ðŸ˜„
